# This playbook will update the /etc/hosts file on your local machine with entries from the hosts file
# one level up. This makes it easier to ssh vi hostname instead of ip address and allows you to use
# the hostname in the URL of the browser
#
# Usage:
# ansible-playbook -i ../hosts update-local-hosts.yml -K
# The -K parameter tells ansible to ask you for your password so it can sudo to edit /etc/hosts
